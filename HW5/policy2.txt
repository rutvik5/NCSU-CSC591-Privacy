You have consented to this collection and processing for a specific purpose;
It is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations; or
It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.

Please review the below information outlining your choices and how to exercise them.  We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe.  If our full response will ever take more than a month due to complexity or scope, we will notify you of this and keep you updated on our progress.




Review and update your data: You have the right to access and update any Personal Data that we have collected.  Some Personal Data, such as the account holder’s name and email address can be found and updated using the account management tools on our website. For any Personal Data beyond this, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section.  We may request more information to confirm your identity before modifying any Personal Data.

After you delete your Personal Data from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not immediately remove data from our backup systems for archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.  We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim.




Restrict Processing: You have the right to restrict how we process your Personal Data in certain circumstances.  This is often an alternative to requesting the complete deletion of your data.  Rather than requesting we delete all of your Personal Data, you may request that we limit our uses of your Personal Data to specific purposes.

Beyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation.  Even after receiving such a request, we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing.


If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request.  If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies.   If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.
