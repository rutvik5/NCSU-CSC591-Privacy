Please make sure to keep the input text files for policy1 - policy5 in the same folder as that of rkolhe_Q2.py

Please make sure to install the following dependencies:
	-> nltk.corpus.wordnet

Note: I have used python 3.7 to build the code

To run the file use the following command
	-> python rkolhe_Q2.py
